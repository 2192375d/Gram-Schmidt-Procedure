# Gram-Schmidt Procedure

A quick program that implements Gram-Schmidt Procedure coded in C

# What is Gram-Schmidt Procedure?

[Gram-Schmidt Procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process) takes an input *linearly independent* list of vectors, and form an *orthonormal* list of vectors by doing some algorithm. This new *orthonormal* list of vectors have the same span as the *linearly independent* list of vectors.

# What does orthonormal even mean?
An orthonormal list of vectors is a list of vectors where each vector is perpendicular to each other and each vector has a norm(magnitude) of 1.
